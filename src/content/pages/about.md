Luka St√§rk. Currently a Student in the last year of M.Sc. Computer Science at TU-Berlin. Permanently an enthusiast about cycling.

My fields of interests in Computer Science are broadly speaking Algorithmics and Optimization, Intelligent Systems and Cryptology. In my last internship at the G-SCOP laboratory in Grenoble I work on new approximation algorithms for Feedback Vertex Set on Tournaments.

I dedicate myself to work for purpose and value. My goal is to solve crucial problems that people are facing and to center humans in technology. I encourage open-door policies, interdisciplinary knowledge exchange and collaboration. Solving complex problems with efficient algorithms is something that motivates me most.

As a Student Worker at [HCC FU-Berlin](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/index.html) I developed Web-Application for the Project [Ideas2Market](https://i2m.imp.fu-berlin.de/) including a database with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co). 

Fun Fact : Born in Manchester!
