Luka St√§rk. Currently a Student in the last year of M.Sc. Computer Science at TU-Berlin. Permanently an enthusiast about cycling. 

My fields of interests in Computer Science are broadly speaking Algorithmics and Optimization, Intelligent Systems and Cryptology. In my last internship at the G-SCOP laboratory in Grenoble I work on new approximation algorithms for Feedback Vertex Set on Tournaments.
