My goal is to solve crucial problems that people are facing and to center humans in technology. I encourage open-door policies, interdisciplinary knowledge exchange and collaboration. Solving complex problems with efficient algorithms is something that motivates me most.</p>\n<p>As a Student Worker at <a href=\"https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/index.html\">HCC FU-Berlin</a> I developed Web-Application for the Project <a href=\"https://i2m.imp.fu-berlin.de/\">Ideas2Market</a> including a database with <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co\">Elasticsearch</a>.</p>","excerpt":"Luka Stärk.
